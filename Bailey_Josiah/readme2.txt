Program 2
Recursive
Compiled using the makefile provided
Command line arguments: xFile, yFile, outputFile (in this order)
Data Structures: Nothing noteworthy used, just iterating through a string.
Computation Time: Runtime would be closer to O(2^n) or O(2^m) depending on which is larger where n = length(xString) m = length(yString)
